#Datatypes in 'c'

       1.int->signed int,unsigned int(4 bytes)
       2.char->signed chr,unsigned char(1 byte)
       3.float->4bytes
       4.long->signed,unsigned(4bytes)
       5.short->signed,unsigned(2 bytes)
       6.double->8bytes

       signed datatypes start from - to...
       unsigned datatypes start from 0 to...


#Ranges for signed and unsigned datatypes

       signed chr= -128 to +127
       unsigned chr= 0 to +255
       signed short= -32768 to 32767
       unsigned short= 0 to 65535
       signed int = -2147483648 to 2147483647
       unsigned int = o to 4294967295

 #Difference between compiler and interpreter

 compiler stands the entire program during the scanning process if any single bug is occurred,entire program was blocked.(c,c++)
 In interpreter if anyline has an issue,it skip that line and executes the remaining code. (python,php,html,css,javascript,node.js,react.js)
  both compiler&interpreter (java)

 OPERATORS:-
    
              1.arithematic operator:-(+,-,*,/(returns float value),//(returns int value),%)
	      2.relational operators:-(<,>,<=,>=,!=,==)
	      3.logical operators:-(and,or,not)
	      4.bitwise operator
 %-gives remainder
 //-floor division gives the result(integer value)
 /-division gives the result with pointing value
 
 #Bitwise operations

 <<left shift means *
 >>right shift means//

 #Logical operators
 1.and   2.or


 MULTIPLE INPUTS IN A SINGLE LIST:-
        E.G.:-
            1.#two inputs in a single line
               n1,n2=int(input("ENTER")),int(input("ENTER"))
                print(n1)
                print(n2)
                s=n1+n2
                print(s)
            2.#give inputs separated by commas
                a,b=input("enter").split(",")
                print(a)
                print(type(a))
                print(b)
                print(a+b)
             3.#give inputs separated by space
                 a,b=input("enter").split(" ")
                 print(a)
                 print(b)
                 print(int(a)+int(b))
